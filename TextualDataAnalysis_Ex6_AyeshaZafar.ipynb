        "Here your task is to extract named entities by prompting a generative model. We will be using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini and openai-python library to access the API.\n",

        "You can use this API key: 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\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Your tasks are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Write a prompt to extract named entities from a news article. Your prompt can either focus on one entity type (in this case, discard other types), or extract multiple entity types in the same prompt. Do not repeat the extraction separately for each entity type (let's save quota here!).\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Write code to access the API, and retrieve results. Debug this with one short request until you know it works!\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Take 10 news articles from the same news data collection (Finnish or English), verify that the selected articles are not extremely long (should be less than 300 words each), discard or truncate longer documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Extract named entities using gpt-4o-mini model from these 10 articles, and store/print the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have any problems of accessing the API with the given API key, you can also return the exercise without results. This is an experimental exercise, which can fail if the API key is invalidated. In this case, preferably post the error you get to discord in case we will have time to investigate, and return your code with the error the API gives. Look for explanation for the error, and write your hypothesis of why it happens.\n",
